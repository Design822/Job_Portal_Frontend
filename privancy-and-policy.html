                <h3>JobsLink Privacy Commitment - Overview</h3>

                JobsLink is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide a safe and secure user experience. This statement explains JobsLink's commitment to managing your personal information and details how and when personal information is collected, held, used, or disclosed. <br><br>

                <h3>Information About All JobsLink Visitors</h3>
                We collect information about our users collectively, such as which areas are visited most frequently and which services are accessed the most. This data is used anonymously and in aggregate form only. It helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how we can continuously improve your experience. We may share this aggregated information with our partners to help them understand how JobsLink visitors use the site, aiming to enhance the overall user experience. We do not disclose individual visit information to outside parties, except when required by law.<br><br>

                <h3>Information About You Specifically</h3>
                As a career site, JobsLink retains your personal information to assist with career management, including finding or retaining employment, or to facilitate other services provided by us. For example, when you sign up for a service, enter a contest, or purchase a product, we collect specific personal information such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card details, qualifications, or career history. With your consent, we may also retain sensitive information, including membership in professional associations or trade unions. Additionally, we may request information on your interests and job preferences to deliver a personalized experience. You can opt to receive communication from us with tips, advice, and surveys on career development. If you initially agree to receive these communications but later wish to opt-out, you can update your preferences in your JobsLink account profile. If you provide information through a co-branded registration page (e.g., a contest co-sponsored by JobsLink and a partner), that information will be shared with both JobsLink and the partner company. JobsLink is not responsible for the partner's use of the information. Failure to provide required information may limit our ability to provide you with services.<br><br>

                <h3>Use and Disclosure of the Information We Collect</h3>
                Resumes: JobsLink allows you to store your resume in our database. You can choose to keep your resume private or make it searchable by employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals who have paid for access to our database. If you choose to make your resume searchable, you can still keep your personal details confidential. We take reasonable steps to ensure access to the resume database is restricted to authorized parties. However, JobsLink is not responsible for the retention or use of resumes by third parties. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.<br><br>

                <h3>Updating Account Information</h3>
                JobsLink is dedicated to ensuring your personal information is accurate and up-to-date. You can change or correct your personal information by logging into your JobsLink account and editing your profile.<br><br>

                <h3>Online Security</h3>
                When purchasing products from JobsLink via the website, your personal and credit card information is protected using SSL encryption technology. While we strive to safeguard your information, no encryption method is completely secure. SSL makes it challenging for your data to be intercepted during transfer. Once we receive your order, it remains encrypted until we process it. JobsLink is committed to securing the information you provide and has procedures in place to protect your data.<br><br>

                <h3>JobsLink Database</h3>
                The information you provide is stored in the JobsLink database located in the Nepal. By providing your information, you consent to its transfer to our overseas database.<br><br>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                To enhance your experience on JobsLink, we use cookies—small files placed on your computer's hard drive by your browser. Cookies help us remember usernames, passwords, and preferences, track click streams, and manage site performance. You can set your browser to reject cookies, but this may affect site performance and your experience.<br><br>

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                JobsLink provides areas on the site for submitting feedback. Any feedback submitted becomes the property of JobsLink and may be used for marketing purposes or to contact you for further site feedback.<br><br>

                <h3>Children</h3>
                JobsLink does not collect information from children. The site is intended for users aged 18 and above.<br><br>

                <h3>Privacy Commitment Changes</h3>
                We may update our privacy commitment from time to time. Changes will be posted on our website so you are always aware of what information we gather, how we use it, and whether it is disclosed. Thank you for using JobsLink. We are committed to offering the best tools and advice to help advance your career. We welcome your feedback and suggestions.
